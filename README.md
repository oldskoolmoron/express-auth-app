🚀 Express Authentication System

This project implements a basic authentication system using Express.js, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and token-based authorization. It includes endpoints for user signup, signin, and a protected route for fetching user information. User credentials are stored in memory, and JWT is used to secure routes, enabling authenticated access to user-specific data.

✨ Features:

• 📝 Signup: Registers a new user by capturing a username and password.
• 🔐 Signin: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT for session management.
• 🛡️ Token-based Authorization: Secures routes by validating JWTs in headers.
• 🔒 Protected Route: Allows authenticated users to access specific data.
